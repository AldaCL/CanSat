# CanSat
## Ground Station System, CanSat On board Telemetry with GY-80, Arduino and Xbee


### Ground Station: 

The system was developed pn python 2.7, implements **OpenGL** , **pygame** , **MatplotLib** and [Drawnow](https://github.com/stsievert/python-drawnow )

Firstly, the program reads 20 values from the sensor in order to calibrate it.

The data sent by the sensor (Arduino / Xbee), make up an array of 15 values for different sensed magnitudes, in order, these are:
* Temperature (In Fahrenheit degrees)
* Presure (Raw pressure, its converted to Pa)
* Altitue (Absolute OSL , with calibration we get height)
* Pitch, Roll, Yaw (Absolute magnitudes, its converted to degrees over calibration position)
* Heading Filtered 
* Kalman Pitch, Kalman Roll; Get after apply kalman filter. 
* Acceleration (X, Y ,Z), Got from Accelerometer
* Gyro (X, Y , Z), Got from Gyroscope. 

Feel free to ignore some magnitudes and use only those that are useful for your purposes< you only need to comment the lines on Arduino code and in python code; also change the size of array to receive. 

Once the sensor was calibrated, it start to receive the meseaurements, at a 19200 baud rate; (Also can be modified, in orden to ajust to your needs, but once again remeber to change this value in arduino code)

A few moments after, the MatplotLib window come up, and shows the plot of data (We only take Temp, pressure, Altitude and height)

And the 3D model of Cansat.

We use the values of Pithc, roll and yaw to emulate the movement of the satellite; Axis were changed from original ones; because of the position of sensor into the CanSat. 


Arduino Script take libraries from [Korneliusz JarzÄ™bski](https://github.com/jarzebski) repositories, just added to libraries dir to facilitate integration.


////Soon more documentation of each function, Xbee conections and the code of Arduino on board.
